                This year I’ve had a lot of free time on my hands with the global pandemic.
                With this abundance of time I’ve decided to start reading again. I’ve decided to
                share some of my favorite quarantine reads. The first book I would recommend is “Lean In:
                Women, Work, and the Will to Lead
                ” by Sheryl Sandberg. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This book is specifically about navigating the tech industry as a woman.
                The target audience is not only geared to women, but anyone interested
                in gender equality in and outside of the workplace. The tech industry
                is well known for being biased against women. This book not only tackles
                the realities women face in tech, but also tries to aid in navigating
                these difficult situations. It explains how gender impacts careers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “Lean In” discusses gender bias outside of tech and even industry in general.
                It explains the obstacles women face in modern life altogether. It really opened
                my mind to new perspectives. Overall this is a great read if you are interested in 
                gender equality. By the end of this book, you understand both the biases women face in 
                and outside of the workplace. You will also be better equipped with how to handle the situation 
                no matter your gender. Gender inequality faces all genders and it’s a great topic to be educated on.

            <h2><b>Quarentine Read #2: Moonwalking with Einstein</b></h2>
            <address>By Clare Kinery</address>
            <time datetime="2020-10-08" title="October 8, 2020">Oct 8, 2020</time>
            <p><img src="images/moonWalking.jpg" alt="Moonwalking book" width="150" height="250"></p>
            <p>
                The second book I chose to share is “Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything”
                by Joshua Foer. I personally have always had what I consider to be a bad memory. I always have trouble
                remembering events and have struggled in history classes. Having a bad memory is something that I have
                always thought of as something I am unable to control.    
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to this, I thought it would be fun to learn more about how memory works. Foer’s book not only 
                explains how memory works but how to improve yours. Foer is a journalist who becomes interested in 
                memory competitions after writing a story on it. He becomes so intrigued that he decides to enter 
                himself. “Moonwalking with Einstein” is about Foer’s journey to becoming a U.S.A memory champion.
            </p>
            <p>
                This story is extremely interesting for anyone who wants to know more about their own mind and how it 
                works. It taught me that my bad memory was not just genetic but something I could improve. After reading
                this, you will have memory tools that will aid in improving your mental agility. The mind is amazing, 
                and a super powerful tool human possess. Overall, “Moonwalking with Einstein” is not only an educational 
                read but fast paced and enjoyable.
